# Employee Data Analysis Project

**Short description:** A complete data analysis project using an employee dataset (`employees.csv`). The project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualization, basic predictive modeling, and instructions to deploy a simple Streamlit dashboard. This repository is suitable for showcasing on GitHub and including in a CV or portfolio.

## Contents
- `employees.csv` - dataset (already provided)
- `analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with step-by-step analysis and visualizations
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - this file
- `cv_bullets.txt` - ready-to-use bullet points for your CV
- `run_dashboard.sh` - quick script to run Streamlit dashboard (optional)
- `notebooks/` - (optional) extra notebook(s)
- `reports/` - (optional) export of figures or PDF report

## How to run
1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd employee_analysis_project
```
2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the notebook:
```
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
```
4. (Optional) Run Streamlit dashboard:
```
bash run_dashboard.sh
# or
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## Project structure & tasks completed
- Data ingestion & validation
- Data cleaning & type conversions
- Exploratory Data Analysis (counts, aggregates, trends)
- Visualizations (bar charts, time series, hierarchy/organizational tree)
- Feature engineering (hire_year, tenure, direct_reports_count)
- Basic predictive modeling (example: logistic regression to predict promotion to manager)
- Exporting results & presentation-ready plots
- README and CV bullets for presentation on GitHub/CV

If you want, I can push this repo to GitHub for you (I will provide commands and a prepared commit), or generate a polished PDF report and presentation slides.
